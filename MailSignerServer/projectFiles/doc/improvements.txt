Improvements to be made:

Need to have:
restructure of ad-user
about box
logging on client clipboard actions
logging in server
better feedback on user login
On rename, case cannot be changed
What happens when client looses connection?
Ability to add outlook folders (for different versions of os or outlook)
Default signature format client
Texts in .properties file

Case:
Empty, create new signature, change it, dont save, create another, choose yes =>
Changes are not saved to the first signature

Nice to have:
Detection of unregistered users and display in the server manager
User/signature rights grid, for mass rights assignment
User fields e.g. IM and Social links/icons
Premium signatures
Server client architecture, with status for clients connectivity
Usage statistics
disclaimer additions
campaigns and periodical signatures
statistics from website on image load (mail read frequency)
OU-deployment of signature (ou's defined in ad)

-Label of computer in db
-Hints in status bar on mouse over
-Server location auto-detection from client (via UDP multicast)
-Status bar with indication of process status
-Processes should run as threads (add and remove signatures only)

-for multi-wing: fields to match old outlook signature program (or maybe just rewriting signatures myself?)
-several workstations enabled; information about deployment status of individual signatures on individual workstations
-tab order on user details
-registration key or web-activation
-Integration with website (user login, combines registration also)
-wysiwyg editor for html+rtf and possibility to view source
-special for rtf; match fields with \{#blabla#}\ instead of {#blabla#} (maybe after wysiwyg editor is in place)
