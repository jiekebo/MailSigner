MailSigner FAQ.

Main program

The purpose of MailSigner is to help you by cutting out the tedious work of filling in contact details of your employees'
many signatures. This is done by giving you an interface where you can design a signature and define the fields where
the employees' details should be entered. 

The employees' details are also handled by the program, and can be entered manually. Bear in mind it is only nessicary 
to enter details once, and the program can even connect with an Active Directory, where users can also be entered 
and synchronised with MailSigner.

To deploy the signatures for the users it is nessicary to have the MailSignerClient.jar run at every startup.


MailSigner consists of two major panes.

- Signature managament pane
To create a new signature, click the gray plus button. You will be asked to enter a name of the signature, this has to be
unique. After you have created a signature, select it on the list to the left. To the right is the editor panes.
Here you have the choice of three different formats for your signature. Txt is for sending to mail clients that only
display text, not images. HTML is for mail clients which can show web content like hotmail, gmail, thunderbird or outlook.
RTF is specifically for outlook.

In the beginning the editor panes will be empty, even after you select the signature you just created.
To start designing a signature begin by entering a desciption of the signature. This will help you recognise the usage
of the signature in the future.

Click the text version tab in the editor pane to start writing the text version of the signature. Bear in mind that the
signature will look exactly the same way as you enter it, provided that it is shown in a monospaced (evenly spaced) font.
To add the contact fields to be filled out by the software put the text cursor where you want the field, then select the 
relevant field from the dropdown box above the editor pane, and click the green plus. This will insert {#firstname#} 
if you were to insert the first name of the users. These fields can be entered manually if you can remember them.

To write the HTML-version click the html tab. Here you will be met by a full scale wysiwyg (what you see is what you get)
editor. The aim of this is to help you write html without knowing html. You can insert tables, change text font, create
links and so forth. Bear in mind when you insert images, not to link an image on your local computer, as it will not
show up on recievers who do not have access to your personal file storage. Instead link to an image located on a web-
server with a url like http://www.someplace.com/img/myimage.jpg. 

To write the RTF-version click the RTF-tab and start writing. Here you have a slimmer choice than from the HTML. The
reason being that RTF is very different from HTML. In RTF you cannot link to images on a webserver, instead the image
has to be included in the RTF-file itself, and sending 1000 mails a day for example will stuff your outbox with the same
image a 1000 times, which is waste of space. We generally recommend you write mail signatures in HTML.

To save the signature click the disk icon in the toolbar. If select a signature on the signatures list, and forgot to
save, your changes will be lost.

To delete signatures mark the signatures in question (if several signatures need deletion user ctrl+click to select
multiple signatures). To delete click the gray minus button on top.


-User management pane
The user management pane is where you keep control of the employees' details. To the left is a list of the users by
their logon name. To create a user click the user with a green plus on it. You will be asked to enter a name of the
user. It is very important to enter the correct logon name of the user, so the software can recognise the user which
logs on. The user is created and will be visible in the list to the left. Click the user to start entering details.

The fields to the right remain empty, so click in one of them and start typing the users information in. When finished
click the disk icon to save the details.

To remove users mark the users in question (if several users need deletion user ctrl+click to select
multiple users). To remove click the user with a red minus on it.

Below the user's details you see a table, which will contain the names of the signatures and have a checkbox next to
them. This is where you control who gets which signature. Simply click the checkbox to enable or disable the signature
for the selected user. To the right of this table you will see as the signature gets deployed, what workstations the
user uses. If the user only uses one computer, you will only see the network name of one computer. If it has been
successfully deployed, a checkmark will appear next to the network name.

To synchronize the software with an Active Directory, a little configuration has to be made first to be able to establish
connection. Go to the file menu and click AD-Options. Here host is either the ip of your Active Directory host, or the
qualifying name and domain of your AD host. The user is the administrative account you use to log into the server, as
well as the password. If your domain is internal.companyname.com you will need to write dc=internal,dc=companyname,dc=com
in this box.

After this click the lightning in the toolbar. After a little while a dialog will pop up and list the users you have in
your AD. Select the ones you wish to make mail signatures for by ctrl+clicking them on the list. Click ok and the users
will be entered into the users list. The fields are grayed out since the data came from the AD. To update a users details
do it in the AD, then mark the user in MailSigner, and click the green arrows to update.
